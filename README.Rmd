The goal of rockr is to:

Given a series of polls \  
    --based on a longitudinally sequenced phenomenon \  
        --where response options reoccur across polls

1.  Wrangle data into an analysis-ready format

2.  Produce multiple scalings and subsets of data for different ways of conceptualizing and slicing poll responses

3.  Render animated bar charts to visualise the cumulative and aggregated sentiment according the series of polls
